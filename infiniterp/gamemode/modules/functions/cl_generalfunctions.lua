/*
Below is a simple index for functions.
All functions work across the game-mode.
The Table of Contents should have a category line such as ///[001]: General/// before the functions to make it easier to edit.
All functions should be prefixed with inf_ to make it gamemode specific.
This is client sided only

[Table of Contents]
